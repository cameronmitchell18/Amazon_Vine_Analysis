## Summary

As you can see, although there are less paid five star reviews, the percentage of those five star reviews make up the majority percentage of those reviews. I was a little shocked though to see how close the unpaid percentage was to the paid percentage. If people are no being paid to review the product as five stars, they really must enjoy / reccomend said product.
